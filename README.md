# FarmingGamePython
Small game I'm working on to teach myself something


It requires lib time and python3
If you want to run script ./GameCode you need linux and code

the ./GameCode and ./GameOn scripts are only for linux

to run this game on windows just do r-click and "open with" and choose python

little instruction for linux users:

first you need to clone (download)

```
git clone https://github.com/Hanuko33/FarmingGamePython
```
then cd to it
```
cd FarmingGamePython
```
then run the ./GameOn
```
./GameOn
```
if you have any issues contact me
