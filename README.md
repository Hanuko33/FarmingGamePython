#Tutorial of installation:
first make sure you are in your home otherwise it wont work:

```
cd
```

second you need to download the game.

```
git clone https://github.com/Hanuko33/FarmingGamePython
```

then cd to it.

```
cd FarmingGamePython
```

cd to bin
====================================================

```
cd /bin
```

or if it didn't worked:

```
cd /usr/bin
```

if both of this things didn't worked then you can try this (but this will only work on your user):

```
cd $HOME/bin
```
=====================================================
after you cd in any of this files then create link inside of bin:

```
ln -s $PATH/FarmingGamePython/FarmingGamePython.py
```
